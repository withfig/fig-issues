# Fig

[Fig](http://withfig.com) is the App Store for the Terminal. We let developers build visual apps and shortcuts that streamline terminal workflows. We then let you share these apps with your team and the community.


# The Fig Issues Repo

The Fig issues repo is a public forum to gather user feedback and discussions on bugs, missing features, and desired enhancements. For questions on how to use Fig, see our [docs](https://docs.withfig.com).
 
As programmers, we want to make Fig perfect. We welcome all user ideas and opinions!



## How to report a bug, missing feature, or suggest an enhancement

1. Open the `Issues` tab above. Search existing issues to see if someone else has already beat you to it. 
2. If someone has, feel free to vote that issue up or add your own feedback in a comment.
3. If not, click the `New Issue` button and explain. 
   -  For bug reports, **please provide your OS version, Fig version, and if possible, detailed steps to reproduce the bug**.

If you have multiple bugs or requests that are not closely related, please separate them into different issues.
